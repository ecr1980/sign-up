This was the sign up project from The Odin Project. On its face, it seemed simple enough. Make a few divs, place them properly, and put the correct items in them.
However, it became a bit trickier once I realized that the password fields would need to match. I needed to use some javascript to compare the fields, and disable 
the submit button if they did not match. I also needed to display a message letting the user know about this requirement. Doing so, without displaying a message
when not needed, and without moving other items around on the page required me to use some of my newly learned skills with positioning.

I also enjoyed this project for what it was. A nice change of pace after a significant amount of reading, and some web work after a long period of strictly running
Ruby programs in the terminal.
